            This is a demo Uploader meant for recruiters to create posts so I'll ask very Nicely
            Pleeaaase don't try to break it. Be a nice person. Be nice to it. <br>
            <br>
            You can drag and drop files below and type some text where is says you can, you can add
            tags to the post by typing them in the tags field; <b>TAGS SHOULD BE SEPARATED BY SPACES</b>
            then click create post to upload the post and look at your page to see the update.<br>
            You don't have to refresh it. <br>
            <br>
            Remember, this is a very very very early demo, like a precursor to the demo in fact, so don't
            judge the design. Also, it might be a little bit slow because it hasn't been optimized yet.<br>
            <br>
            <b>If you like looking at raw json and want to hit the API endpoints yourself with Postman or any other API
            tester, email me at eoo5498[at]rit[dot]edu and I'll send you the urls</b><br>
            <br>
            ENJOY!!
