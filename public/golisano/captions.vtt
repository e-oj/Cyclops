00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey!

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.090
Hi

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Rachel

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.180
I'm going to help you pick a college 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.210
and a major! Exciting!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.080
Yup. There's no need to freak out.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.170
Even if it seems like...

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.000
All of your friends know where they're going...

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.010
Remain Calm. Stay Cool. Chill Out. 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.220
Relax. I got you. 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.180
I'm so good at art. 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.130
Maybe some of your friends are going for 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.120
CS

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.080
Computer Science!

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm guessing you knew that...

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.180
Yay

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.110
Bear with me here...

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.050
Computers and Science! 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.160
RIT

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.070
is a great school

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.190
In general but also...

00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:36.200
for computer science!

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.070
But maybe

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.010
you want more! 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.070
You really do. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.090
There's TONS

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.120
of computing majors 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.000
at RIT

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.080
Tell me more! 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.040
The information science and technology department 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190
What a lovely sounding department 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.160
Has some

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.000
Brand new majors! 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.200
Yay!

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.010
What are these exciting new majors??

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.200
Computing and Information Technology 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.200
and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.010
Web and Mobile Computing 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.130
#options

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.020
Cool!

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.000
But, like, what does that even mean?

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.090
Let me show you!

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.100
Welcome to RIT

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.000
Don't worry!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.080
I'm still here.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.040
To tell you about the...

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.160
New majors! 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.000
Computing and Information Technology

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.060
and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.190
Web and Mobile Computing

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.120
RIT is so innovative

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.050
Technology is always chainging...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.140
RIT embraces these changes!

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.150
Students stay ahead of the game

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.130
Majors in the IST department prepare students...

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.080
Like this guy!

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.190
for success after graduation.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.220
sure

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.180
it's not like every college says that 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.110
I get that. 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.140
But in these new majors you will have...

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.020
Hands on experience 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.180
...get it?

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.060
Exciting collaborative projects

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.140
Real-world experience through...

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.210
Co-ops!!

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.020
If co-ops aren't exciting to you,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.080
You should rethink some things. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.170
In my humble opinion of course 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.040
so you say,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.210
GREAT

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.100
I HAVE OPTIONS AT RIT

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.010
I'm interested in all of it 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.150
but...

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.00
I don't already know that much CS! 

00:04:54.00 --> 00:04:55.020
Don't worry! Fret not! 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.110
You can learn! 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.050
I WANT TO LEARN 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.020
you say 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.130
But...

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.140
I don't love Rochester

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.030
well

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.190
Study abroad is always an option

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.020
RIT has campuses all over the world!

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.180
There are computers all over the world you could be messing with! 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.210
amazing

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.220
you say

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.120
I'm interested in CS but I have options at RIT 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.100
Like the new majors in the IST department 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.400
Computing and Information Technology and 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.120
Web and Mobile Computing 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.020
I know your excited

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.200
and want to learn more 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.030
I WANT TO LEARN you say
