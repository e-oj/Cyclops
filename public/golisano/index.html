               <P>Web and mobile computing explores ubiquitous application development with a firm focus on the end user experience. Students have an interest in the technology of today (and tomorrow), but they’re also interested in how people use that technology. The Web and mobile computing major is about combining people and technology to bring out the best in both. </P>

               <P> What truly sets our graduates apart is their ability to see the world through the eyes of the user. Creating an impactful App begins with solid code and good design, but understanding user expectations is the cornerstone of that process. In the Web and mobile computing major, students learn a user-centric approach to application creation. That, coupled with a robust developer skillset, enables them to produce applications that connect with multiple users across varied environments. </P>

               <P>The curriculum is structured with this in mind. Students learn how to integrate the back end code with the front end UI, and will be able to do it across several languages and platforms. This comprehensive knowledge enables students to impact the App design process at all levels, making them incredibly valuable to employers seeking today’s application developers. Students can also specialize on one of four areas, which provides students with the knowledge they need to pursue a professional or personal aspiration. </p>

            <div id="computing-stuff">
                <P>Students in the computing and information technologies major are characterized by their hands-on approach to technology. They are designers and builders, but primarily they’re enablers. Students approach complex problems and create custom solutions that help users meet their goals. They play an integral role in any modern organization, often working behind the scenes to deploy technology where it’s needed most. </P>

                <P> That versatility is the core principle of our major. People are interacting with computers more than ever before. With that comes a need for professionals that have the broad practical skills to facilitate those interactions across a variety of sectors. Not only do computing and information technology students learn to implement complex systems, but they become well versed in their management as well. Every day, more companies are realizing the benefits that IT professionals bring to the table. </P>
